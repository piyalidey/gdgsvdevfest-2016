__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick).__

GDG Silicon Valley prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means inappropriate behavior isn’t allowed at GDG meetings. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we expect:

- Be nice. We're all part of the same community, so be friendly, be welcoming, and generally be a nice person. Be someone that other people want to be around.

- Be respectful and constructive. We're a very diverse group (95 countries and counting!), so we're not going to agree all the time. Remember to be respectful and constructive with your communication to your fellow GDG'ers. Don't get into flamewars, don't make personal attacks, don't vent or rant unconstructively. Everyone should take responsibility for the community and take the initiative to diffuse tension and stop a potential flamewar or negative thread as early as possible.

- Be collaborative. Work together! We can learn a lot from each other. Share knowledge, update the wiki, help each other out.

- Participate. This is YOUR community, so be a part of it! Join in on discussions, show up for in-person meetings regularly, offer feedback, and offer to help implement that feedback!

Participants violating the code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and GDG-SV at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizers immediately.
