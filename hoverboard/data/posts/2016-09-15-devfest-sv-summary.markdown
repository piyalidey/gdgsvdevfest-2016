It's been a while since [GDG DevFest West 2015](https://devfest2015.gdgsv.com/). it was a great success. We are happy to share with you some facts, emotions and, of course, photos from the biggest Google Developers Conference in Ukraine!

A BIG THANK to all the volunteers for their priceless help,  thanks to all the speakers for the great presentations and sharing their experience and knowledge, and, of course, thanks to [Google](https://www.google.com)

The event took place on the 21st of November at the Google Campus. Devfest was focused on Android, Web and Cloud technologies and also Community Hub. Over 300 people participated in the event with a mix of students and working professionals.

**A day full of discoveries:**

* 3 parallel tracks of Android, Web and Cloud technologies and also community hub.
* Around 30 sessions. No marketing - just technical hardcore!
* The widest geography of our [speakers](https://devfest2015.gdgsv.com/#!/speakers) (many of them are [GDE](https://developers.google.com/experts/)) - Canada, Australia, UK, Turkey, Czech Republic, Ukraine.

* A Fireside Chat with a great collection of Google Developer Experts to answer your questions, including Said Tahsin Dane, Chiu-Ki Chan, Ryan Harter, Wiebe Elsinga, and Mike Wolfson:

Also [Martin Omander](https://twitter.com/martinomander) showed us how building a multi-player game with Firebase and Angular made him a better Dad in the process.
