    "description": "In this presentation code lab, the presenter, a google cloud platform authorized instructor, will be delivering selected modules and labs from a new course being developed by Google Cloud Platform team called CPB201 – Cloud Bigtable and Cloud Dataproc. Cloud Dataproc is a managed Spark and Hadoop service that lets you take advantage of open source data tools (Spark, Pig, Hive and Hadoop) for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning. Cloud Bigtable is Google’s NoSQL Big Data database service designed to power massive workloads that requires consistent low latency and high throughout. As such Big Table is powers core Google’s products such as Gmail, Search. \nThe agenda for this code lab looks as follows \n1. Introduction to Google Cloud Dataproc (25 min) \n2. Dataproc Lab 1, Part 1 (15 min) \n3. Dataproc Lab 1, Part 2 (35 min) \n4. Introduction to Cloud Bigtable  (20 min) \n5. Bigtable Lab 1 (35 min)",

    "description": "It is time to get out of your web browser boundaries! With a new technology \"Web Bluetooth\", our Progressive Web Apps are finally able to communicate directly with Physical Devices and control them. Whether it is a heart-rate sensor, a BB-8 robot, or your smart refrigerator - Web Bluetooth got you covered. In this talk, we will learn the basics of the underlying Bluetooth Low Energy technology, then cover the Web Bluetooth APIs, and finally engage in a live demo where we will control a Smart Light Bulb, as well as a cute 3D-printed Robot, directly from a web page.",

ZzzZzzzz With the new N release, Doze mode becomes the rockstar. He rushes into the room with a big shabang by shooting all background services and network requests that forgot to get away. He should no longer be shy. He just shoots and dances on bones of your scheduled alarms, while you wonder why this particular task is no longer running. With the new Doze mode, you require to adapt your app architecture to the new reality. On this talk, we will learn how to survive Doze mode using Job Scheduler, Content Provider and stay in one piece.",

    "description": "Building scalable real time applications is a tricky proposition at the best of times. You have to deal with all the hard problems: device network performance, real-time bidirectional communication, scalable infrastructures and distributed system complexity. \nBy leveraging some popular open source libraries such as Docker, Kubernetes and gRPC, we are able to mitigate many of these issues to quickly build a scalable, real time experience that can be accessed around the world by millions of people. \nDuring this talk, we will look at how gRPC can be used as a performant, real time communication framework that works across platforms such as desktop, mobile and embedded devices as well as over ten languages. We will also combine this with Kubernetes’ powerful ability to orchestrate containers at scale, such that we can handle and coordinating large amounts of traffic.",

You can scale up to deal with the excess traffic, but what do you do when your load is variable? How do you do that, and stay on budget? \nThis session is a case study on getting an App Engine app to scale to serve 30,000,000 requests an hour.  It will take you through the architecture, the code changes and the technology trade offs to get to that level of traffic.",
