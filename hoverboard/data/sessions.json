    "description": "Doze mode is just around the corner. Introduced in Marshmallow, as the shy guy that was allowed to step in only when your device went to sleep. ZzzZzzzz With the new N release, Doze mode becomes the rockstar. He rushes into the room with a big shabang by shooting all background services and network requests that forgot to get away. He should no longer be shy. He just shoots and dances on bones of your scheduled alarms, while you wonder why this particular task is no longer running. With the new Doze mode, you require to adapt your app architecture to the new reality. On this talk, we will learn how to survive Doze mode using Job Scheduler, Content Provider and stay in one piece.",

With a new technology 'Web Bluetooth', our Progressive Web Apps are finally able to communicate directly with Physical Devices and control them. Whether it is a heart-rate sensor, a BB-8 robot, or your smart refrigerator - Web Bluetooth got you covered. In this talk, we will learn the basics of the underlying Bluetooth Low Energy technology, then cover the Web Bluetooth APIs, and finally engage in a live demo where we will control a Smart Light Bulb, as well as a cute 3D-printed Robot, directly from a web page.",

Once set up, Retrofit is designed to make declaring endpoints as simple as a method on an interface with annotations. Behind that simplicity, though, there is a lot of power and knowing how to use and configure it can make even the most problematic APIs easy to use.",
